        What a great hobby
    </h2>
    <p>
        For me, I find my hobby of <em>gaming</em> to be a really nice hobby. I use this hobby to release stress. Here are some of my <em>most recently played games</em>.
        <ul>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li><strong>Barotrauma</strong></li>
            <li>Terraria</li>
            <li>Ghost Runner</li>
            <li>Returnal <em>(Not the Pc port because I've heard it's bad)</em></li>
        </ul>
        Even though I enjoy these games greatly, there are others that I have been either waiting to get, or unable to play yet.
        <ol>
            <li>HellDivers 2</li>
            <li>Ghost Runner 2</li>
            <li>HellDivers</li>
            <li>Anomaly Watch <em>(I don't know if I will though because it's kind of spooky)</em></li>
        </ol>
        Here is a <a href="https://betterbi.netlify.app/"> cow</a> or more than one if you wait long enough.
